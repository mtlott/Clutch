# Docker container for Clutch

This is a Docker container for Clutch.

Clutch provides a bridge between a DVR which outputs EDL files such as [Channels-DVR](https://channels.com) and an automated version of [Handbrake](https://github.com/jlesage/docker-handbrake).

The GUI provides only status information through a web-based VNC session.

The fully automated functionality provides watch folders: drop files into a watch folder and let Clutch process them without any user interaction.

Clutch is an EDL (Edit Decision List) splicer tool which utilizes ffmpeg to cut segments from a video file without reencoding.

Clutch is based on the amazing work of jlesage on [docker-handbrake](https://github.com/jlesage/docker-handbrake)
